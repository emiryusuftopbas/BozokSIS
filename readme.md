# BozokSIS
BozokSIS is student information system for universities. BozokSIS is written using php, javascript and jquery.

I coded it for the final project of web programming course given in Bozok University computer engineering program.

My project has been graded 85 / 100.

## Used programming languages , frameworks and libraries

### Used back-end technologies

- MariaDB.

### Used front-end technologies

- Bulmacss html&css framework for this project.Because it is lightweight and open source and css only html&css framework.

## How BozokSIS Works

### Login and Signup

There are 3 tables for users in the database.

- admins

	Administrator stored in this table.
- academicians

	Academicians stored in this table.
- students

	Students stored in this table.

When signing up , only email addresses with the extension bozok.edu.tr yobu.edu.tr and ogr.bozok.edu.tr are accepted.
If the e-mail address ends with ogr.bozok.edu.tr, the system automatically registers to the students table.

Student e-mails at Bozok University are in format **studentnumber@ogr.bozok.edu.tr** .

Student number contains the students faculty and program information.
Example 16008118009 , first four digits are the faculty code and the next 3 digits are the department code.
By using this scheme, the system adds the faculty and department code match from the faculties and departments table to the automatic student registration.

If the e-mail address is bozok.edu.tr or yobu.edu.tr, the system automatically registers to the academicians table.

Academicians and students cannot log in to the system immediately after they are registered to the system, an administrator must approve them.
